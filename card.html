          Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of
          matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any
          animal species.

          Large, black-and-white with a medium-sized white eye patch, killer
          whales live in open water. They reach 7 meters in length and live on
          average for 40 years. Killer whales get their name from mythologies of
          indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the
          souls of humans to merciless killers.
